Subscribers of the service register by choosing a city and a programming language. Once a day, there is a selection of all subscribers who want to receive emails with vacancies and based on their preferences (which city and which YAP), a list of urls is formed for which parsers are launched to collect vacancies for these parameters. After the parsers work out, sending emails to those who want to receive a newsletter is started.
